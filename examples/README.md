Some examples you can use to play are in this folder.

The circle_packing_with_artifacts and function_minimization exaples are copied from [openevolve](https://github.com/algorithmicsuperintelligence/openevolve/tree/main/examples). The only change I made to them was make the evaluator return a dict instead of openevolve's EvaluationResult wrapper.

I create the sorting_optimization example for testing.
